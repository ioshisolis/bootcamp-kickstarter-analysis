## Analysis and Challenges




### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This analysis is comprehensive of the final outcome (successful, failed or canceled) by the launch date. In order to complete this, a pivot table was created by using the Parent Category: theater as a filter, but also the years, in order for the information to be displayed by month. As the rusult of this analisis we must conclude that May was the best month to launch the kickstarter campaing for theater, also we can say, that december is not that good of a month.
