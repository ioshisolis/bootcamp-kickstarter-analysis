# Kickstarting with Excel bootcamp-module-1 

## Overview of Project

An anlysis of The Kickstarter Funding Campaings was conducted based on the information given at module 1. This data set includes different parent categories such as film,games, food, plays, etc. It also includes several golas and pledges with successful, failed, and cancel outcomes. By using Excel and it´s formulas, pivot tables and charts a report would be provided based on the specifications made by Lousise.  


### Purpose

Louise wants to know how different cmapaigns performed in relation to their lunch dates and their funding goals. The main purpose of this project is to provide two graphical deliverables paying specific atention to the catory theater and subcatergory of playas in relationship with the launch dates and golas, along with this witten document. 

## Analysis and Challenges




### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This analysis is comprehensive of the final outcome (successful, failed or canceled) by the launch date. In order to complete this, a pivot table was created by using the Parent Category: theater as a filter, but also the years, in order for the information to be displayed by month. As the rusult of this analisis we must conclude that May was the best month to launch the kickstarter campaing for theater, also we can say, that december is not that good of a month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This analysis is comprehensive of the final percentage for (successful, failed or canceled) outcome of the subcategory of plays. In order to complete this a new spreadsheet was create with the range of goals given by the client, it also includes the number of successful, failed or canceled campaings and their total, to finalize this information is also represente on percentages. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challanges i had was with the las formula COUNTIFS since the range for the Goals has values between different numbers. I had to add and extra if (new range, new criteria).

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first quarter is the better time to launch a campaign, the number of campaings cancel it alwasys stays the same. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The best campaings have goals less than 1000 or between 20000 and 24999, this get a better successful percentage. This also shows that no campaings where cancel for the subcatery of plays. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

It will be good to know weher are the plays being shown, or what theaters are participating. Also zipcodes of whete the theaters and people that pledge are. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Relationship between outcome and peldge to compare it with the goals. 
Relationship between Outomes by average donation in the differente categories
Relationship between numeber of backers and the outcome.
